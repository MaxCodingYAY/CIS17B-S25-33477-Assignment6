This is an inventory system with a fully functional graphical user interface. 
It provides input fields for the item ID, description, and location. 
The ID can contain either letters or numbers but must be unique for each item.
In contrast, the description and location fields can contain any values. Once an item is added, it will appear in the display box below. 
The "Remove" and "Find" buttons allow users to locate or delete items by entering the corresponding item ID.
